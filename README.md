# Pontus Snibb's Wreck of Blues

First Milestone project for Code Institute: User-Centric- Frontend Development.

A central website to show and advertise the band "Pontus Snibb's Wreck of Blues."
Currently the band has a lot of content on many different sites and this website should provide a central location so viewers can observe, example and interact with the band.

## Demo
You can view the website live on [GitGub Pages](https://wreckofblues-milestoneproject1-brendanoshea.c9users.io/main.html).

## UX

 This website should help prospective clients to sample the band by highlighing their performance, reviews and keep viewers up-to-date with coming shows. 
 At the moment the band uses spotify, youtube and facebook as their main out-sourcing of their material. This site should help centralize their material, ensuring easier access for viewers under one site.

The band has their own style which this site tries to stay true to aa well as using a stark contrast with orange to highlight and pop important information. 
As the band already has a lot of internet sources, this site centralizes these sites and also provides quick links. Therefore while this site showcases many of the highlights, 
it further encourages viewers to view their other source material. 

## Technologies

1- Html
2- Css
3- Bootstrap

## Features

### Navbar

Navbar is in a fixed top right position allowing users quick access around the page. Its a button that stays open until clicked and has quick links to the different sections.
The background is an opaque orange that highlights over the background without overpowering the page. 

### Introduction 

The site opens to a strong welcome page of the band with a quote, in swedish, from Pontus Snibb. An eye catching "Latest News" in a contrast of orange against the soft blue 
highlights the next gig and their lastest song. Both these links will open new appropriate pages to find/sample the latest the band has been working on.

### Tour Shows 

The bands next gigs/shows posters are advertised  Also a quick link to their Facebook page for more detailed information on their shows.

### Music 

An embeded Spotify player which plays their current and previous album. The Spotify player allows for 30sec of samples before asking to join spotify for free, or if already a member a quick access to Wreck of blues. In Sweden spotify is a very common app on devices.
News articles on the band performances and reviews are also presented here. 

### Video 

A Youtube embedded player that shows a live 12min performance of the band. This shows the skills and the interaction of the band towards the audience. 
This is a show case if viewers would like to hire the band for private parties or gigs, or are simply interested in what they sound like live.

### Contact form 

Allows future customers to approach the band to increase bookings for the band or to ask questions.
The form is not currently complete, for the writer has not learnt the next process. 

### Social link 

A quick link to other sources for the band.

### Future Includions

At the moment the band's merchandise is limited but the band wants to increase their stock. When this happens, a merchandise area on this site will be needed.
At current the only object you can physically purchase is their albums from amazon. 
The band has said merchandise is not as important, it will however be a needed feature in the future. 
An extra page for gig and tour photos should be included in future developments.

## Testing

### Introduction

Through out the project, the different sections has their own id. The navbar links has been checked and go to the right positions.
The Navbar is from bootstrap and has been modified by using the provided documentation. I did run into some problems for placement of the navbar for the right hand side.

### Latest News

Both buttons open links to outsourced material. First is to their next gig on facebook. Second opens youtube page. 

### Tour Shows

The posters have links to Facebook. When clicked, a new page for the link will appear, at present these links all head to the events page of the Facebook page. 
These are old events that had the better posters. 

### Music

I used Spotify embedded players, for these was the only source to their music without purchasing the music tracks myself. Spoitfy has a free service where the viewer is able to listen to 30secs per track, 
before been told to 'sign in.' For a premium member, these players allow full access to these two cds. These players worked on the writers computer and tested on his personal phone.

### Video

To show different skill set, these video is embedded youtube and not a link to a youtube page.  

### Contact form

Form is not completed as such that the form will not submit but will reset. A mondal will drop, with a warning that the band is not taking any bookings as such. Once I understand the next process,
I will make these avaiable for the public. 
At this moment, an error sign will open if the required field is not filled in (only address is optional).

### Social link

Social logos has been taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and been linked to outsourced material, like facebook, youtube, amazon, spotify.
All these links will open new pages.
Links to the top of the page has been tested and all go to the beginning of the page.
